# Introduction

Our Documentation is divided in several sections:

- [Setting up a deriv app](/docs/application_setup.md)
- [Core Concepts](category/core-concepts)
- [Languages](category/languages)
- [Client Libraries](category/client-libraries)
- [FAQ](category/faq)
- [Guides](category/guides)

### Quick Start

Please skim through our [Core Concept](category/core-concepts) pages, these pages will help get familiar with our `websocket server api` features, the concepts introduced in these pages are not related to any of our frameworks or libraries, so in order to use our `websocket server api` in an efficient way it's better if you grasp all the information provided there.

When you're done with [Core Concept](category/core-concepts) you can choose your implementation approach based on the language / framework / library you want to work with in your application.

Using our [Client Libraries](category/client-libraries) is optional and you can get the same result with the tutorials provided in [Languages Section](category/languages) as well, but our client libraries provide more `robust`, `type safe` API calls for you.

### Using our websocket server with just languages features

If you decided that you want to use our `websocket server` with pure languages feature of your choice please check out [Languages Section](category/languages) continue your journey from there.

:::caution
We suggest using our [Client Libraries](category/client-libraries), since they give you better developer experience.
