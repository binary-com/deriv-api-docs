Our Documentation is divided in several sections:

- [Core Concepts](category/core-concepts)
- [Code Examples](category/code-examples)
- [Languages](category/languages)
- [Guides](category/guides)
- [Setting up a deriv app](/docs/setting-up-a-deriv-application.md)

### Quick Start

Have a look at the [Core Concept](category/core-concepts) page and take your time to read through it. These concepts will help you get familiar with our websocket server api and how to use it more efficiently. They are not related to any of our frameworks or libraries.

When you read through the [Core Concept](category/core-concepts) page, you can start choosing your implementation approach based on the language / framework / library you want to use in your application.

have a look at the [Languages Section](category/languages) and continue your journey from there.
