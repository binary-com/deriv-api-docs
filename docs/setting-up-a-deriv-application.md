#### Deriv account

If you don't have a Deriv account yet, you can easily create one by visiting our signup page or using the <a href="/api-explorer#new_account_virtual" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new_account_virtual</a> API call. It's completely free. And if you have an account already, please log in using your account details. To avoid any accidental loss of funds during testing, we recommend using your demo account instead of a real account.

To earn markup, get a Deriv real account to receive your monthly earnings. You can also create a real account using <a href="/api-explorer#new_account_real" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new_account_real</a> or <a href="/api-explorer#new_account_maltainvest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new_account_maltainvest</a> API calls.

:::caution
To create Deriv applications, you'll need an API token with the Admin scope for the account you wish to use for your application.
:::

## How to create a Deriv API token

To create your API token, simply go to the Dashboard and select the **Manage Tokens** tab. From there, create a new token that matches the access level needed for your application's features.

To create a new API token, follow these steps:

1. Select the scopes you need.
2. Provide a name for your token
3. Click **Create**

Alternatively, you can create an API token via the <a href="/api-explorer#api_token" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">api_token</a> API call.

:::caution
You need a token with the `Admin` scope to create an application.

**To create an application, follow these steps:**

1. Select the account you want to create the application with.
2. Select the API token added to your account ( it must have the \`Admin\` scope ).
3. Provide a name for your application.
4. Fill the **Markup** and **OAuth details** fields.
5. Select the **Authorisation Scopes** needed by your application.
6. Click **Register Application**.

Make sure the **Authorisation** and **Verification** URLs are correct based on your implementation.

**`https://example.com/verify`**
