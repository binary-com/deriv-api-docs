## What is the Deriv API?

The Deriv API is a tool that allows developers to build custom trading applications that interact with the Deriv trading platform. Think of it as a way for developers to create their own specialized tools to help people trade on the Deriv platform in a more efficient or personalized way. With the Deriv API, developers can access a wide range of functionality, including placing trades, retrieving account data, managing orders, and accessing real-time market data. This can be helpful for traders who want to customize their trading experience or use specialized tools to make more informed trading decisions. Overall, the Deriv API gives you more flexibility and control over your trading experience, allowing you to create your own customized solutions that better fit your trading style and goals.

## How do I use it?

Here are the steps to use the Deriv API:

1. **Register for a Deriv API account**: Go to the Deriv API website and sign up for an account. Once you have registered, you will receive an API token that you can use to authenticate your API requests.

2. **Familiarise yourself with the API documentation**: The Deriv API provides comprehensive documentation that explains how to use the API endpoints, including the available parameters and response formats. Make sure you are familiar with the documentation before you start using the API.

3. **Create an API application**: To create an API application, you need to provide a name for your application and a redirect URI. The redirect URI is the URL that the user will be redirected to after they have authorised your application to access their Deriv account.

4. **Authorise your application**: Once you have created your API application, you need to authorise it to access your Deriv account. This involves logging into your Deriv account and granting permission for your application to access your account data.

5. **Make API requests**: Once your application is authorised, you can start making API requests. You can use the API to retrieve information about your account, place trades, manage orders, and perform other trading-related tasks.

6. **Test your API integration**: Before launching your application, make sure you thoroughly test your API integration to ensure that it is working correctly.
