Our Documentation is divided in several sections:

- [Setting up a deriv app](/docs/setting-up-a-deriv-application.md)
- [Terminology](category/terminology)
- [Core Concepts](category/core-concepts)
- [Languages](category/languages)
- [Client Libraries](category/client-libraries)
- [Guides](category/guides)
- [FAQ](category/faq)

### Quick Start

Have a look at the [Core Concept](category/core-concepts) and [Terminology](category/terminology) pages and take your time to read through it. These concepts will help you get familiar with our websocket server api and how to use it more efficiently. They are not related to any of our frameworks or libraries.

When you read through the [Core Concept](category/core-concepts) and [Terminology](category/terminology) pages, you can start choosing your implementation approach based on the language / framework / library you want to use in your application.

Using our [Client Libraries](category/client-libraries) is optional and you can get the same result with the tutorials provided in [Languages Section](category/languages) as well, but our client libraries provide more `robust`, `type safe` API calls for you.

### Using our websocket server with just languages features

If you want to use our websocket server api with a specific coding language, then have a look at the [Languages Section](category/languages) and continue your journey from there.

:::caution
We suggest using our [Client Libraries](category/client-libraries), since they give you better developer experience.
