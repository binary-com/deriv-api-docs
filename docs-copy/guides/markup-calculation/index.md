## Earning commission

You can earn commission on trades and payments your clients perform via the websites and apps you create with Deriv API. Get more details about the commission plans [here](https://www.deriv.com/partners/affiliate-ib).

## Markup

You can also earn from markups on every contract purchased via a trading app you created with Deriv API. The markup is defined by you and can be up to 5%.

Here is an example of how the markup is calculated.

To get a payout of **2 USD**:

- Client stake without markup = **1.07 USD**

With the markup (e.g. 2%), a client pays:

- Client's stake with the markup = Stake + (payout x markup)
- Client's stake with the markup = 1.07 USD + (2 USD x 2%) = **1.11 USD**
