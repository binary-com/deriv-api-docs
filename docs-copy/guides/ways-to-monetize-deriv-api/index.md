## Monetizing Deriv API

There are several ways to monetize Deriv API:

1. **Charge for access to your trading application**: If you have built a custom trading application using Deriv API, you can charge users a subscription fee or a one-time fee to access your application. This can be a viable revenue stream if your application provides value to users.

2. **Charge for premium features**: If you have built a trading application with advanced features, you can charge users for access to those features. For example, you could charge users extra for access to real-time market data, advanced charting tools, or other premium features.

3. **Affiliate marketing**: You can join Deriv's affiliate program and earn commissions for referring new users to the Deriv platform. This can be a good option if you have an audience that is interested in trading or investing.

4. **Referral fees**: If you have built a trading application that integrates with the Deriv platform, you could offer referral fees to users who refer new users to your application. This can be a good way to incentivize users to spread the word about your application.

5. **Advertising**: If you have built a trading application that has a large user base, you could consider selling advertising space to relevant advertisers. This can be a good way to generate additional revenue.
